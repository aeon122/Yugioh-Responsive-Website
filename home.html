                <p>The "Egyptian Gods" are one-of-a-kind all-powerful cards created by Maximillion Pegasus, who modeled them after three Ancient Egypt divine beasts whose likenesses surround the Millennium Puzzle on the stone tablet said to hold the memories
                    of the nameless Pharaoh.</p>

            <p>When Pegasus decided to make them into cards, everyone involved in the project was attacked by the spirits of the "Egyptian God" monsters, so Pegasus decided to create the cards on his own, under the protection of his Millennium Eye. When
                Pegasus finished the art-work on the prototypes, he had a nightmare about the Egyptian Gods attacking him. Shadi told Pegasus that he had angered the "Egyptian gods".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-5">
            <p> Pegasus woke up injured after this "nightmare," so he decided that these cards were too powerful to be mass-produced, and had Ishizu Ishtar bury the prototypes in the Pharaoh's tomb. The wielder of these great cards is able to acquire the
                title of "Duel King," but in the wrong hands, they are capable of causing legitimate injury or even death. Using counterfeits of the "God" cards also proved to be deadly, as Marik Ishtar found out when his Rare Hunters were testing counterfeited
                copies of "The Winged Dragon of Ra", some ended up being crippled, some lost their minds, and some even died the moment the card was played. Marik came to the conclusion that the "Gods" respond to the strength of heart of the Duelists,
                of which none of the members of the experimental group had, and to this end, he gave Odion a copy of "Ra", reasoning that he would be able to control it due to his past as a servant of the Tomb Keepers. Unfortunately, this proved to be
                incorrect, resulting in both Duelists being struck down.</p>
